<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
**AppTrail** is an **Android app** to get information about StarTrail and will help you with settings of your camera.

## StarTrail:
STARTRAIL is a type of photography in which we immortalize the motion of the earth's rotation on the sensor and therefore the camera, being integral with the earth, will record this movement through the so-called "swipe" of the stars. To create this type of photo, a sequence of images is taken with a long exposure and then "merged" into a single photograph using the image processing software.
The stars leave a circular trace around a point that seems almost fixed: POLAR STAR, in fact the earth's rotation axis passes approximately precisely in correspondence with this star; this only happens if you find yourself photographing north of the equator, while south of the equator you cannot see the North Star. If, on the other hand, you are at the equator, see the stars leave a straight and parallel streak with each other.


### Guida:
This is the ensemble of activity to informe users about the startrail and how to use the app, there are some example images of this photography type. At the same time there are two links of amazon to shop the requirment. Below you can view gif example.
